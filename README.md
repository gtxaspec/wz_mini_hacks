### v3/PANv2 devices ONLY

Run whatever firmware you want on your v3/PANv2 and have root access to the device.  This is in early stages of testing, use CAUTION if you are unsure of what you are doing.  No support whatsoever is offered with this release.  

**Do not contact the manufacturer for information or support, they will not be able to assist or advise you!**

## Important matters related to security
Using this project can potentially expose your device to the open internet depending on the configuration of your network.  You alone are responsible for the configuration and security of your network, make sure you are aware of the risks involved before using.

## Related Projects:
* wz_mini_debian: run full debian in a chroot, on the camera!
* wz_mini_utils: various statically compiled binaries for use with the camera (mipsel)


## Features

* No modification is done to the device filesystem. **_Zero!_**
* Custom kernel loads all required files from micro-sd card at boot time
* Wireguard and IPv6 support enabled
* Supports the following USB Ethernet adapters: 
  * ASIX AX88xxx Based USB 2.0 Ethernet Adapters
  * ASIX AX88179/178A USB 3.0/2.0 to Gigabit Ethernet

* USB gadget support, connect the camera directly to a supported router to get an internet connection, no USB Ethernet Adapter required, using USB CDC_NCM.
* Easy uninstall, just remove files from micro-sd card, or don't use a micro-sd card at all!
* Add your own changes to run at boot into the script on the micro sd card located at /media/mmc/run_mmc.sh, mount nfs, run ping, whatever you want
* Ability to update to the latest stable or beta firmware, this mod should survive updates as long as the bootloader remains the same
* Ability to block remote AND app initiated firmware updates
* Works on ANY firmware release (so far!)
* DNS Spoofing or Telnet mod are *not* required prior to installation
* RTSP Server included, stream video and or audio over LAN

## How you can help!
* Vertical Tilt on the PANv2 doesn't work properly.  Only does this on the modified kernel.  Need investigation why this happens.

## Prerequisites

* Person
* Computer
* 256MB or larger Micro-SD Card is required!

## What Works / What Doesn't Work
* Everything works except:

  1. PAN v2:
     -  Tilt (Vertical) only works at motor speed 9

## Setup

1. git clone the repo or download the repo zip
2. format micro-sd card as fat-32 ( this is a hard requirement, the bootloader does not support ex-fat or ext, and thus will not load wz_mini ), volume name does not matter.
2. copy all the files inside of SD_ROOT to your micro sd card
3. __SSH is enabled, but is secured using public key authentication for security.  Edit the file ```wz_mini/etc/ssh/authorized_keys``` and enter your public key here.  If you need a simple guide, [how to use public key authentication](https://averagelinuxuser.com/how-to-use-public-key-authentication/)__

## Installation
1. Turn off the camera
2. Insert the micro sd memory card into the camera
3. Turn on the camera
4. The camera will proceed to boot, then you may connect via the IP address of your device using SSH, port 22.  The username is root.  It may take a few minutes for the device to finish booting and connect to Wi-Fi, then launch the SSH server.  Be patient.
5. You may also login via the serial console, password is WYom2020

## Removal
1.  Delete the files you copied to the memory card, or remove the memory card all together.  The next time you boot the camera, you will return to stock firmware.

## Customization

Edit run_mmc.sh, this is a script stored on the micro sd card that is run when the camera boots.  You can change the hostname of the camera, mount NFS, add ping commands, anything you like.

Wireguard support is available as a kernel module:

```
ENABLE_WIREGUARD="false"
```

Use the command ```wg``` to setup.  See [https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/) for more info.

---
Disable automatic firmware updates:

```
DISABLE_FW_UPGRADE="false"
```

If a remote or app update is initiated, the camera will reboot due to the failure of the update.  The firmware update should not proceed again for some time, or at all.  

When a firmware update is initiated, due to a bootloader bug, we intercept the update process and flash it manually.  This should now result in a successful update, if it doesn't, please restore the unit's firmware manually using demo_wcv3.bin on the micro sd card.

---

USB Ethernet Adapter support:

```
ENABLE_USB_ETH="false"
```

the next time you boot your camera, make sure your USB Ethernet Adapter is connected to the camera and ethernet.  The camera has to be setup initially with Wi-Fi for this to work.  After setup, Wi-Fi is no longer needed, as long as you are using the USB Ethernet Adapter.  Note that using USB Ethernet disables the onboard Wi-Fi.

---

USB Direct Support:

```
ENABLE_USB_DIRECT="false"
```
  
the next time you boot your camera, make sure your USB cable is connected to the router.  Remember, the camera has to be setup initially with Wi-Fi for this to work.  After setup, Wi-Fi is no longer needed.  Note that using USB Direct disables the onboard Wi-Fi.  Change the MAC Address if you desire via USB_DIRECT_MAC_ADDR variable.

Connectivity is supported using a direct USB connection only... this means a single cable from the camera, to a supported host (An OpenWRT router, for example) that supports the usb-cdc-ncm specification. (NCM, not ECM) If you have an OpenWrt based router, install the ```kmod-usb-net-cdc-ncm``` package.  The camera should automatically pull the IP from the router with most configurations.  You can also use any modern linux distro to provide internet to the camera, provided it supports CDC_NCM (e.g., on raspberrypi you will need to load the module cdc_ncm (modprobe cdcm_ncm).  enjoy!
 
Enabling this feature *THIS ALSO REQUIRES THAT ENABLE_USB_ETH="true"*



---

Remote Accessories:

When USB Direct connectivity is enabled, the camera will be unable to communicate with accessories.  To enable remote spotlight accessory support, enable the following variable and set the IP Address of the host as follows:
```
REMOTE_SPOTLIGHT="true"
REMOTE_SPOTLIGHT_HOST="0.0.0.0"
```

Then, run the following command on the host where the spotlight is attached to:

```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:9000,reuseaddr,fork /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0
```

Change ```/dev/ttyUSB0``` to whatever path your spotlight enumerated to if necessary.  The camera will now be able to control the spotlight.

---

USB Mass Storage Support:

```
ENABLE_USB_STORAGE="false"
```
If you would like to mount an EXT3/4 filesystem, also change:

```
ENABLE_EXT4="false"
```

---

CIFS is now supported:

```
ENABLE_CIFS="false"
```

---
To enable RTSP streaming, change the following lines, you can choose to enable or disable audio.  Set your login credentials here, you can also change the port the server listens on.

```
RTSP_ENABLED="false"
RTSP_ENABLE_AUDIO="false"
RTSP_LOGIN="admin"
RTSP_PASSWORD=""
RTSP_PORT="8554"
```
the stream will be located at ```rtsp://login:password@IP_ADDRESS:8554/unicast```

Note:  If you don't set the password, then the password will be the unique MAC address of the camera, in all uppercase, including the colons... for example:. AA:BB:CC:00:11:22.  It's typically printed on the camera.  VLC seems to work fine for playback, ffmpeg and others have severe artifacts in the stream during playback.
